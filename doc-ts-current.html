<h4>Measuring Solenoid Current</h4>
<p>
	What you need:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A volt meter capable of measuring 10-50 millivolts A/C</li>
	<li>Your WSC-LP1</li>
</ul>
<h5>Start the zone under test</h5>
<p>
	Using the 
	Activities Page
	or the
	<a href="doc-set-setup.html">Zone Setup Dialog</a>,
	start the zone you wish to measure.
	Observe the LEDs on the WSC-LP1 and confirm the correct
	zone if running.
</p>
<h5>Measure the voltage</h5>
<p>
	Make sure your meter is set for "volts A/C" or "millivolts A/C"
	and measure the voltage between the test point "TP" and either
	COM terminal. 
</p>

<h5>Multiply by 10</h5>
<p>
	Multiply the voltage measurement by ten to get
	A/C current.
	E.g. 31mV = 310mA.
</p>
<p>
	Note the startup current through the solenoid can be several times higher than
	the steady-state A/C,
	but this transient current is not dangerous nor will it normally trip the PTC fuse.
</p>
<h5>So What?</h5>
<p>
	If a zone has been <a href="doc-ts-shorts">isolated</a>
	it is a good idea to measure the zone current before  
	<a href="doc-set.html#doc-set-zone-status">putting the zone back into regular service</a>.
	You should compare it to other zones you know are working.
	Allowing a solenoid to operate which is drawing high current
	cannot be a good thing in the long run.
