<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>Configuring the Radio</h3>
<h4>Before We Begin</h4>
<p>
	Your WSC-LP1 has to be powered before we can configure the radio.
	The most convenient method is to 
	<a href="doc-bat.html">power the unit with a 9V battery</a>.
	This way you can work nearby your WIFI router where you know the
	signals will be good.
</p>
<p>
	Or you can
	<a href="doc-wirepower.html">power the unit with a 24VAC wall transformer</a>.
	In that case you'll have to work close to the wall transformer.
</p>
<h4>What You Need</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The name and password for your wireless network</li>
	<li>A wireless device such as a smartphone or notebook computer</li>
	<li>Your WSC-LP1, powered either by battery or 24VAC</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cheat Sheet</h4>
Here's the short & sweet of what we're going to do:
<ol>
	<li>Connect your wireless device to the WSC-LP1</li>
	<li>Browse to 1.1.1.1</li>
	<li>Select your WIFI network from a list</li>
	<li>Enter your WIFI network password</li>
	<li>Test and save the configuration</li>
</ol>
<h4>Connect Your Wireless Device to the WSC-LP1</h4>
<p>
	Using the WIFI functions on your wireless device, scan for a network
	named "WSC-LP1".
	Select it.
	No password is needed.
	If the WSC-LP1 network does not appear, see 
	<a href="doc-ts-confwifi.html">this troubleshooting topic</a>.
</p>
<h4>Start a Browser and Go To 1.1.1.1</h4>
<p>
	Wait for your wireless device to connect, 
	start up a browser and 	go to the address "1.1.1.1".
	Note that the WSC-LP1 follows web standards. 
	Internet Explorer does not.
	You may get unpredictable results using I.E.
</p>
<h4>Enter Your Network Name and Password</h4>
<p>
	In a few seconds a page appears listing the networks within range of
	the WSC-LP1. 
	If your network is in the list, select it.
</p>
<p>
	If your network is not in the list, select the link "other...."
</p>
<p>
	Enter your network name (if requested) and password. 
	Press the "Test" button.
	If the test fails you can retry, re-enter your password or cancel.
	Give it a few tries before giving up.
</p>
<p>
	If the test succeeds, you're good to go.
	Note the IP address assigned to the WSC-LP1 by your WIFI router.
	You may need this in the future.
	Then press the "Save" button.
</p>
<h4>Congratulations</h4>
<p>
	You've done the hardest step setting up your WSC-LP1, by far.
	After saving your network credentials, the WSC-LP1 restarts 
	and connects to your WIFI network.
	Your wireless device may issue an error message when the WSC-LP1
	reconnects.
	This is normal.
</p>
<h4>Wait for your wireless device to reconnect to you network</h4>
<p>
	Once your wireless device notices the WSC-LP1 controller has disappeared
	it will automatically reconnect to your WIFI network.
	You can do that manually as well.
</p>
<p>
	The final page produced by the WSC-LP1 controller includes a link
	to the controller on your WIFI network.
	DO NOT click this link until your wireless device has re-connected
	to your WIFI network.
