<h3>WIFI</h3>
<h4>Weak Signals</h4>
<p>
	The WSC-LP1 radio operates very well with signal levels -89dBm and higher.
	From -90dBm to -93dBm operation degrades, but the controller is usually
	functional.
	Signals weaker than -93dBm will cause disconnects and interruption of the
	web server interface. 
</p>
<p>
	If you're having trouble with signal strength, here are some things to try.
</p>
<h5>Location location location</h5>
<p>
	Small changes in the location of the WSC-LP1 can affect signal strength,
	especially at extended ranges.
	Unmount the unit, 
	<a href="">power it with a battery</a>,
	and 
	<a href="">monitor the WIFI signal strength</a>
	as you move it around.
	Mount it where you have the best reception. 
</p>
<p>
	Similarly, if you have the option of moving your WIFI router, 
	<a href="">monitor the WIFI signal strength</a>
	while you move the router.
	Place the router where you get the best performance.	
</p>
<h5>Try different channels</h5>
<p>
	The WIFI b/g/n spectrum is divided into 11 channels.
	Most routers automatically select a channel, and it's usually
	channel 5.
	If you have neighbors, and their routers are also in auto mode
	(highly likely) then channel 5 will be crowded. 
</p>
<p>
	If your router provides the option, try channels 11 or 10.
	They work best in my crowded WIFI space.
</p>
<p>
	In theory the lowest channels have the best chance of penetrating walls.
	Didn't work for me, but give it a try.
</p>
<h5>Use a narrow bandwidth</h5>
<p>
	If your router has the option, use the narrowest bandwidth
	possible.
	This is a tradeoff between range and speed:
	a wide bandwidth has less range but higher speed;
	a narrow bandwidth has better range but less speed.
	If your WIFI network is streaming high volume data like
	movies, you may want to stick with wide bandwidth.
</p>
<h5>No substitute for horsepower</h5>
<p>
	Last resort, consider boosting your signal.
	There are numerous options, too many to recommend here.
