<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>Wiring</h3>
<h4>Power Wiring</h4>
<p>
	The WSC-LP1 runs on 24VAC power.
	This is usually provided by a plug-in transformer.
	The transformer should be rated for at least 
	2 amps or 50 watts.
</p>
<p>
	It is strongly recommended you unplug the transformer
	while connecting wires.
</p>
<h5>Two wire transformers</h5>
<p>
	The transformer may have two or three wires. 
	If you have a two-wire transformer simply connect
	the wires to the two outside terminals on the three-position
	power terminal block.
	Leave the center terminal empty.
</p>
<h5>Three wire transformers</h5>
<p>
	If you have a three-wire transformer then one wire is labeled ground, 
	or center-tap, or sometimes 9V.
	That wire goes to the center terminal on the WSC-LP1 power block.
	The other two wires go to the outside terminals.
	If you're not sure, after you plug in the transformer, 
	use a volt meter and measure the voltage across
	the outside power terminals.
	It should be 24 to 26 VAC.
</p>
<p>
	(Note the WSC-LP1 will run fine even if the transformer is miswired.
	However, your sprinkler solenoids will not work very well, they may
	draw excessive current, and fuses may blow.
	So check for 24VAC if you're not sure.)
</p>
<h5>A/C polarity</h5>
<p>
	COM is in phase with the left terminal of the power block.
