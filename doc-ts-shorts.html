<h4>Excessive Current and Short Circuits</h4>
<p>
	See also <a href="doc-ts-current.html">Measuring Solenoid Current</a>.
</p>
<p>
	The WSC-LP1 is protected by a PTC fuse 
	which trips at 500mA to 1A total current flow from the power transformer.
	This includes current flow through valve solenoids.  
</p>
<p>
	The electronics in the WSC-LP1 consume less than 25mA A/C current, 
	so if the PTC fuse trips it will usually be due to a wiring problem
	or faulty solenoid.
</p>
<p>
	When the PTC fuse trips, power to the WSC-LP1 electronics and solenoids
	is cut off immediately.
	The triacs which switch A/C to the solenoids shut down.
	Whatever load the controller was powering is shed.
</p>
<p>
	When the PTC fuse detects the current has dropped to safe levels,
	it automatically reconnects A/C to the WSC-LP1 power supply, 
	and the system restarts.
	The controller performs the following safety checks:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		The log files are checked to see if a sprinkler zone was
		powered on when power was lost.
		If so, the log record for that zone is flagged "DNF" and 
		<i>the zone is placed in isolation or disabled</i>.
		See below.
	</li>
	<li>
		If a program was scheduled and/or running when power
		was lost
		<i>the program is terminated and not rescheduled</i>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Normal operation resumes as soon as the clock is initialized.
	</li>
</ol>
<h5>Zone Isolation and Disabling</h5>
<p>
	Isolated zones are shown on the Actvities and Settings pages
	with the 
	<img class="status-icon" src="warning.svg"/>
	icon.
	When a zone is isolated it is removed from its normal
	position in watering schedules, and forced to the "back of the line".
	This allows the other zones to complete their programs before
	the isolated zone runs.
</p>
<p>
	If a zone is isolated, and a subsequent fault is detected,
	the zone is disabled.
	Disabled zones are shown in the Settings page with the
	<img class="status-icon" src="disabled.svg"/> icon.
	Disabled zones are removed from manual and scheduled activities.
	You are responsible for putting the zone back into operation.
	You should
	<a href="doc-ts-current.html">examine</a>
	and fix whatever problems are
	causing excessive current draws before returning the zone
	to service.
</p>
<h5>What about power outages and intentional restarts?</h5>
<p>
	The WSC-LP1 cannot tell the difference bewteen a power outage and
	a PTC fuse shutdown.
	So if power goes out while a program is active the controller 
	will isolate whatever zone was active.
	After a power loss,
	<a href="">check the activity log</a>
	to see if a zone may have been affected. 
</p>
<p>
	Similarly, while zones are active,
	avoid actions which reset the controller.
	These actions include 
	resetting the WIFI configuration,
	changing the WIFI SSID and
	downloading new firmware. 
	If you cannot postpone such actions,
	at least 
	<a href="">clear the work queue</a>
	first.
</p>
<h5>Why aren't interrupted programs restarted?</h5>
<p>
	It's all about the water police.
	Where I live we can be fined hard for running
	sprinklers at the wrong time.
	I can't think of a fool-proof way to restart a program
	and guarantee it won't violate local ordinances. 
</p>
<p>
	You're free to restart an interrupted program whenever you want.
