<h4>Problems Configuring the Radio</h4>
<h5>I can't find the WSC-LP1 network</h4>
<p>
	First, confirm the WSC-LP1 is powered and running.
	The 24VAC LED should be on steady.
	The Status LED should be flashing.
</p>
<p>
	Next, confirm the WSC-LP1 needs to be configured.
	The pattern of the status LED indicates this by
	flashing a long "on" and short "off" pattern.
	It's easy to recognize -- if the status LED is on more than off, 
	the radio needs to be configured.
</p>
<p>
	If the status LED is off more than on, the controller is already configured.
	Read elsewhere how to <a href="">find the controller's IP address</a> or
	<a href="">force the controller into radio configuration mode</a>.
