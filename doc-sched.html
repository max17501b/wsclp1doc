<h3>Schedules</h3>
<p>
	<img class="icon" src="prog.svg"/>
	The Schedules page controls the scheduling and
	details of <i>Programs</i>.
	A program defines when sprinklers come on,
	and how long they stay on, and a few other details.
</p>
<h4 id="schedsum">Schedule Summary</h4>
<img src="schedule.png" class="fieldset"/>
<p>
	First thing on the Schedules page is a <i>schedule summary</i>.
	This tells you
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Whether the scheduler is running or suspended.</li>
	<li>What program is scheduled next, and roughly when it starts.</li>
	<li>And buttons are provided to suspend or resume scheduling.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	On the right of the summary is one of two buttons.
</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><img class="button" src="pause.svg"/></td>
		<td>Suspends the schedule</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img class="button" src="run.svg"/></td>
		<td>Resumes the schedule</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
	When you suspend the scheduler,
	it stops any future scheduled activity
	until you resume scheduling.
	You might do that for instance if you see rain forecast
	and you don't expect to need the sprinklers for a few days.
</p>
<p>
	Currently running programs continue to completion.
	Programs which are due to run are skipped until scheduling is resumed.
</p>
<p>
	To immediately turn off all running programs use the
	<a href="doc-act">Activities Page</a>.
</p>


<h4 id="progsum">Program Summaries</h4>
<img src="progsum.png" class="fieldset"/>
<p>
	A program summary is displayed for each program stored on the controller.
	The controller comes with a built-in program called 
	"Zone Test" which will be used for illustration.
	The summary shows the program name (Zone Test),
	how it is scheduled (manual start) and
	how long it runs (6 minutes).
	There are also three buttons associated with each
	program:
</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><img class="button" src="edit.svg"/></td>
		<td>Runs an editor so you can 
		<a href="doc-sched-edit.html">change the program details</a>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr id="manualstart">
		<td><img class="button" src="run.svg"/></td>
		<td>Runs the program right here and now. This is the only way to
		run manual-start programs.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img class="button" src="delete.svg"/></td>
		<td>Deletes the program. There is no "undo".
		But programs are stupid-easy to recreate so
		don't freak out.</td>		
	</tr>
</table>
