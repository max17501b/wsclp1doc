<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>Temporary Power</h3>
<p>
	The WSC-LP1 can be temporarily powered with a 9-volt battery
	in order to configure the WIFI radio.
</p>
<h4>What you need</h4>
<p><ul>
	<li>A 9-volt battery with a two-wire "snap connector"</li>
	<li>Your trusty WSC-LP1 controller</li>
</ul></p>
<h4>Powering the WSC-LP1</h4>
<p class="warning">
	<span>The WSC-LP1 cannot operate valve solenoids
	using battery power. Do not connect valve wiring, or attempt to
	activate zones while under battery power.</span>
</p>

<p>
	The battery is connected to the 3-terminal A/C power connector
	on the lower left side of the controller unit, as shown above. 
	Use a common 9V
	"snap connector". Secure the red lead to the left screw terminal,
	and the black lead to right terminal.
	Leave the middle terminal unconnected. 
</p>

<p>
	As soon as power is applied the 24V power indicator
	LED should light, and the status LED should flash. 
</p>
<p>
	If the LEDs fail to light as described disconnect the battery and check
	that the wiring polarity is correct (red to (+) black to (-)) and
	check that the battery is fresh. 
</p>
<p>
	The controller
	draws about 25mA. A fresh alkaline battery should provide better
	than 12 hours operation.
