<p>
	Select the time zone for your controller.
</p>
<p>
	In more detail, make sure the controller time zone is the same as
	your browser time zone.
	As far as I can tell, modern browsers get their time zone from their host
	operating system, and you cannot do much to change it.
	So it's probably safe to say the WSC-LP1 time zone should be the same as
	the host PC/whatever which runs your browser.
</p>
<p>
	If the WSC-LP1 time zone is out of sync with your browser time zone things
	can get confusing. 
	So try to keep them the same.
