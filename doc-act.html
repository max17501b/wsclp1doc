<h3>Activities</h3>
<p>
	<img class="icon" src="status.svg"/>
	The Activities Page shows the status of your enabled watering zones
	and the activity currently queued to run.
	You can turn zones on and off.
	You can pause, resume and purge the work queue.
	And you can view the Activity Log.
</p>
<h4 id="actzones">Zone Status</h4>
<img class="fieldset" src="actzones.png"/>
<p>
	The zone status display lists all your 
	<a href="doc-set.html#doc-set-zones">enabled zones</a>
	and their current status.
	The <img class="button" src="zoneoff.png"/>
	icon signifies the zone is off.
	The <img class="button" src="zoneon.png"/>
	icon signifies the zone is on.
</p>
<h4 id="zoneonoff">Turning zone on &amp; off</h4>
<p>
	You can manually turn zones on and off clicking or tapping the
	zone status icon.
	Turning off an active zone removes its entry from the work queue.
	The next job in line becomes active.
</p>
<p>
	Turning on an inactive zone puts a new job entry at the front
	of the work queue.
	The job runs for 60 second.
	Any current activity is postponed.
	Normal operation resumes when the newly inserted job finishes.
</p>

<h4 id="actwq">Work Queue</h4>
<img class="fieldset" src="wq.png"/>
<p>
	The Work Queue is a list of watering activity ready to go.
	Each entry in the queue comprises a zone and a duration.
	When an entry reaches the top of the queue, that zone is
	turned on and left on for the specified duration.	
</p>
<p>
	Entries get into the work queue in several ways:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>When the start time of a scheduled program is reached
	the program is divided into entries and inserted in the queue.</li>
	<li>If you manually start a program it is divided into entries
	and inserted in the queue.</li>
	<li>If you manually start or test a zone
	a single 60-second entry is inserted at the front of the queue.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="actmanwq">Managing the Work Queue</h4>
<p>
	The work queue display includes one or more buttons on the
	right margin which you can use to manage the queue.
</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><img class="button" src="pause.svg"/></td>
		<td>Click this button to <i>pause</i> the work queue.
		All activity stops and remains in queue.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img class="button" src="run.svg"/></td>
		<td>Click this button to <i>resume</i> the work queue.
		Activity resumes with the top-most entry.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img class="button" src="delete.svg"/></td>
		<td>Click this button to clear the work queue.
		All pending entries are removed.
		There is no "undo" for this action.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
	You use the pause/resume sequence to temporarily stop watering.
	Maybe you want to fix a sprinkler head or someone is working in the
	area and doesn't need watering. 
</p>
<p>
	Use the clear button the immediately stop and remove all queued work.
	You might use this if a program got started by accident,
	or the forecast changes and you don't want to finish an
	already-scheduled program.
</p>

<h4 id="actlog">The Activity Log</h4>
<img class="fieldset" src="actlog.png"/>
<p>
	Click the Activity Log button to view the latest
	watering activity.
	The date, time, zone and duration of each
	zone operation is listed,
	in reverse-time order.
	The report includes 75 of the most-recent watering events.
	Depending on your watering schedule this may span
	several weeks. 
</p>
<p>
	If you find a zone has been isolated or automatically disabled,
	look in this report and you should see one or more records
	listing the zone as "DNF".
	This means the zone was started but did not finish,
	indicative of an 
	<a href="doc-ts-shorts.html">over-current shutdown</a> 
	of the controller.
