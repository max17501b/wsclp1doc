<h2>Operation</h2>
<h3>Settings</h3>
<p>
	<img class="icon" src="setup.svg" />
	The settings page configures the name, timezone, zone details and
	other miscellaneous features of the WSC-LP1 controller.
	You should review these settings once when the controller is first
	set up, and you'll rarely have to visit this page again.
</p>

<h4 id="doc-set-name">Controller Name</h4>
<p>
	Type a name for your controller.
	This name will identify the controller on your WIFI network
	and in your browser.
</p>
<p>
	If you have multiple WSC-LP1 controllers make sure
	each has a unique name.
	This makes it easier to distinguish them on your WIFI network,
	and in your browser.
</p>
<p>
	Your WIFI router may restrict names to alpha-numeric characters, 
	and the dash and underscore characters.
	So don't go overboard with exotic names unless you know your
	network accepts them. 
</p>

<h4 id= "doc-set-tz">Time Zone</h4>
<p>
	Select the time zone for your controller.
</p>
<p>
	In more detail, make sure the controller time zone is the same as
	your browser time zone.
	As far as I can tell, modern browsers get their time zone from their host
	operating system, and you cannot do much to change it.
	So it's probably safe to say the WSC-LP1 time zone should be the same as
	the PC/phone/whatever which hosts your browser.
</p>
<p>
	If the WSC-LP1 time zone is out of sync with your browser time zone things
	can get confusing. 
	So try to keep them the same.
</p>

<h4 id="doc-set-zones">Zones</h4>
<p>
	The WSC-LP1 supports up to six sprinkler solenoids,
	called "zones".
	The settings page lists each zone
	along with its status, description and a setup button.
</p>
<h5>The zone status icon</h5>
<p>
	Zone status is indicated by these icons:
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td><img class="status-icon" src="check.svg"/></td>
			<td>Zone is ready, good to go.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img class="status-icon" src="warning.svg"/></td>
			<td>
				Zone is <i>isolated</i>.
				A zone is isolated if it is suspected of
				<a href="doc-ts-shorts.html">drawing excessive current</a>.
				Isolated zones are taken out of the normal program order
				and run after all other zones have finished.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img class="status-icon" src="disabled.svg"/></td>
			<td>
				Zone is <i>disabled</i>.
				Disabled zones are removed from normal operations.
				They can only be run via the 
				<a href="doc-set-setup.html">setup test procedure</a>.
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</p>
<h5 id="doc-set-zone-status">Changing zone status</h5>
<p>
	To change a zones status click or tap on the zone icon.
	Clicking a ready zone disables it.
	Clicking an isolated zone disables it.
	Clicking a disabled zone readies it.
</p>
<h5>Using the Setup Button</h5>
<p>
	Click or tap the Setup button to configure the
	description, order and wire color for a zone.
	Setup also allows testing disabled zones.
	For more details see 
	<a href="doc-set-setup.html">Zone Setup Procedures</a>. 
</p>
<h4 id="doc-set-deadtime">Dead Time</h4>
<p>
	When the controller switches from one sprinkler zone to another,
	there are good reasons to pause for a few seconds.
	Many of your consumer-grade sprinkler valves rely on water pressure to
	fully seat the valve in a closed position.
	A short pause before starting the new zone allows full pressure to develop
	and helps ensure valves seat properly.
</p>
<p>
	Another benefit involves the triac devices which switch A/C power to the valve
	solenoids.
	Traics do not switch off instantly.
	A short pause before starting a new zone ensures all triacs are fully off
	before the new zone switches on.
</p>
<p>
	Select a dead time between 1 and 10 seconds.
	On my own system I use 8 seconds.
	It takes about 5-6 seconds for my valves to shut off.
</p>
<h4 id="doc-set-comcolor">Common Wire Color</h4>
<p>
	Record the color of your COM wire here.
	If you ever have to move or re-wire your controller
	you will appreciate knowing which is the COM wire.
