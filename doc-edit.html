<h3>Editing Programs</h3>
<p>
	<img class="icon" src="edit.svg"/>
	The Edit page controls the definition and modification
	of <i>Programs</i>.
	A program defines when sprinklers come on,
	and how long they stay on, and a few other details.
</p>

<h4 id="editname">Name</a></h4>
<img class="fieldset" src="editname.png"/>
<p>
	Type in a descriptive name for the program.
</p>
<p class="warning">
	There may be a bug in WSC-LP1 version 1.0.8 which
	will cause problems is program names are duplicated.
	Take care to ensure program names are unique.
</p>

<h4 id="editzwt">Zone Water Time</h4>
<img class="fieldset" src="editzwt.png">
<p>
	Type in the watering time (in minutes) for
	each zone.
	Times can range from 0 to 120 minutes per zone.
</p>
<p class="warning">
	You can enter time values greater than 120 minutes,
	but these values will be truncated by the controller
	and limited to 120 minutes.
</p>

<h4 id="editschedmet">Schedule Method</h4>
<img class="fieldset" src="schedmet.png"/>
<p>
	The schedule method editor selects one of five
	methods for scheduling programs.
</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td class="selector">Every Day</td>
		<td>The program runs at the same time (defined below) every day.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="selector">Odd Days</td>
		<td>The program runs at the same time (defined below) every other day, on odd-numbered days.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="selector">Even Days</td>
		<td>The program runs at the same time (defined below) every other day, on even-numbered days.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="selector">Day Of Week</td>
		<td>The program runs at the same time (defined below) 
		on specific days of the week (also specified below.)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="selector">Manual</td>
		<td>The program can only be 
		<a href="doc-sched.html#manualstart">started manually</a>.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h4 id="editst">Start/End Time</h4>
<img class="fieldset" src="editst.png"/>
<p>
	The Start/End Time editor specifies the time-of-day when a program starts
	or finishes.
	The editor has two parts:
	First you choose whether to specify time as a start time,
	or an end time.
	"What the hell?" I hear you ask.
	Start time is obvious.
	You want the program to start at 08:00 or 16:00 or whatever.
	It finishes when it's done.
</p>
<p>
	But let's say you live in the land of the water police where
	watering after 08:00 gets you a big ticket.
	You have a swell program that finishes at 07:55.
	But then you notice the petunias look a little parched so you
	up that zone by 10 minutes and BOOM you get a $200 ticket.
	Wouldn't it be better to say you don't care when a program starts
	so long as it <i>ends</i> by 07:55? 
	That's what the "End at" selector does.
	The controller automatically starts the program so it finishes
	at or before the end time.
</p>
<p>
	The actual start/end time is local time, 24-hour format.
	E.g. 2:00PM = 14:00.
</p>

<h4 id="editsd">Schedule Days</h4>
<img class="fieldset" src="editsd.png"/>
<p>
	The Schedule Days editor only appears if you have
	selected the scheduling method "Day Of Week".
	Pick the days on which you want the program to run.
	Clicking or tapping a particular day will select
	or de-select that day.
</p>

<h4 id="editsb">Soak Breaks</h4>
<img class="fieldset" src="editsb.png"/>
<p>
	Soak breaks interrupt your program to let water
	percolate and soak into hard ground,
	or zones prone to run-off.
	It works by dividing long water times into
	shorter times,
	and rotating between zones.
</p>
<p>
	One soak break divides your program into two equal parts.
	Two soak breaks make three equal parts, etc.
	Soak breaks add nothing to the actual watering time for a zone,
	it just breaks the time up.
