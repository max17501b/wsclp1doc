<h5>Zone Setup Procedures</h5>
<p>
	If you look at this and think, 
	This is <i>insanely</i> complicated,"
	then relax, ignore it, do something else.
	This is all optional,
	only takes a few seconds,
	only has to be done once,
	and it can save you time and trouble later.
</p>
<p>
	Zone Setup lets you define three properties for each zone.
</p>
<h6>Description</h6>
<p>
	Type a short description for the zone,
	something like "Rose Beds" or "North Lawn".
	This will appear in the 
	Actvities page,
	the 
	Activities Log,
	the
	Program Editor,
	and the
	Settings page.
	It will make these pages and reports more meaningful.
</p>
<h6>Priority</h6>
<p>
	Change priorities to reorder zones.
	You may find you want zones to run in an order different
	from the natural wiring order.
</p>
<h6>Wire Color</h6>
<p>
	Why record wire color?
	If you've ever moved or replaced a sprinkler controller
	you would know.
	Figuring out which zone is on which solenoid is on which
	sprinkler heads can take a while,
	so save all that accumulated wisdom.
</p>
<h6>Using the Test button</h6>
<p>
	The test button turns on the zone's solenoid for 60 seconds.
	This action overrides disabled status, and
	interrupts any other zone activity.
</p>
<p>
	The purpose of testing a zone might be
</p>
<ul>
	<li>To determine for sure what solenoid/sprinklers the zone services</li>
	<li>To see if the zone is <a href="doc-ts-shorts.html">drawing excessive current</a></li>
	
</ul>
