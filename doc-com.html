<h4>Identifying the COM Wire</h4>
<p>
	If you are replacing a working sprinkler controller you might want
	to note the color of the common (COM) wire before disconnecting the
	old controller.
	If you're not sure, keep reading.
</p>
<h5>What you need</h5>
<ul>
	<li>All your solenoids wires, disconnected</li>
	<li>An ohm meter</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Make sure the wall transformer is unplugged and keep the power wires well
	separated from the solenoid wires.
</p>
<h5>Method</h5>
<p> 
	Sprinkler solenoids are wired with a "hot" (usually colored) wire for each solenoid,
	and a common (COM -- usually white) return wire shared by all solenoids.
	Assuming your wiring and solenoids are in good working order,
	when you measure the resistance between any two wires you will get
	one of three results:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>High resistance: open circuit, one or both wires are not used</li>
	<li>Two-coil resistance: both wires are "hot"</li>
	<li>One-coil resistance: one wire is COM</li>
</ol>
<p>
	I guess you could also get a low (short circuit) resistance if you have
	multiple COM wires, but I'd be pretty suspicious if I saw such a measurement.
	More than likely, this indicates a wiring fault or failed solenoid.
</p>
<p>
	Coil resistance varies, depending on the brand, model and age of your solenoids.
	New Sunbird solenoids measure around 40 ohms.
	Older Sunbirds measure 30-32 ohms.
	Your solenoids should be in this ballpark.
</p>
<p>
	Absolute resistance isn't important. 
	What we're looking to distinguish are two-coil vs. one-coil resistance:
	50-80 ohms vs. 25-40 ohms.
</p>
<p>
	The COM wire will measure the same (one-coil) resistance across all
	the other wires, or an open circuit across unused wires.
</p>
<p>
	Hot wires will measure two-coil resistance across other hot wires,
	one-coil resistance across the COM wire, and open circuit across unused wires.	
</p>
<p>
	Unused wires measure open circuit everywhere.
	Soon as you find one bend it out of the way.
	No point measuring it over again.
</p>
<p>
	So find that one wire that measures one-coil everywhere, that's your COM.
	Hint: it is usually the white wire, but check anyway.
